  <p>&amp; Hello world. This is my first website!</p>
  <p>This is my first website for the semester, but I want to introduce myself for you guys.</p>
  <p>My name is Juan Garcia and I am a ITM major, and this is my second year being in IIT. </p>
  <p>A little about me, I like to play video games so if anyone wants to play I'm always down. </p>
  <p>Lastly, I love to code and have been practing on my freetime. If anyone wants to hit up and collab on some projects I'm also up for that as well.</p> 
  <p>This is the end for my website, so thank you for reading it! Have a nice day!</p>
